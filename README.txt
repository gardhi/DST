This is a DST (design support tool) for the Buthan project compiled by Gard Hillestad
based on the functionality that was implemented and developed by Stefano Mandelli
and furthermore augumented by Håkon Duus

Changes from the deprecated version:
- modularization
- naming
- encapsulation

%% The deprecated script was a mathemathical model of the simulink-version of the microgrid.
(ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION)
% It is very simplified, and is to give a fast simulation of the situation
% over the year, based on simple input-data.
% This script is a combination of the script SAPV_buthan_01[...] from Stefano Mandelli
% and 'fullYear_script' from Hakon Duus.

%% INTRODUCTION
% Input Notes
% - Input time series (Solar, Load) must be already yearlized (i.e. 365x24=8760
% values needed)
% - Solar: Incident global solar radiation on PV array required
% 
% Plant Notes
% - Inverter sized on peak power
% - Ideal battery:
%         simulation: water tank with charge and discharge efficiency, with
%         limit on power / energy ratio 
%         lifespan: discharge energy given by battery cycle compared with 
%         discharged energy during simulation
% - Ideal PV array: temp effect can be considered
%
% Optimization Notes:
% - Find the optimum plant (minimum NPC) given a max accepted value of LLP


%% Note on the data
% the data from 2009-2013 are data collected from Statnett, and manipulated
% in the script resize. The data called LoadCurve_scaled_2000 is the
% standard data picked from the model of Stefano Mandelli and is not
% manipulated in any way. It is only renamed for running-purposes.

% LoadCurve_scaled_1 is a constant array with the same energy over the year
% as 2000, but with same hourly values every day year around.

% LoadCurve_scaled_2 is a fictive load, with different loads in weeks and
% weekends

% LoadCurve_scaled_3 is the constructed curve from Bhutan
